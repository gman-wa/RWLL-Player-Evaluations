# RWLL-Player-Evaluations
Data entry piece for LL evaluations to match evaluation numbers with skill determination

2017 - Branch added for RNLL.  Different approach to evals.  Multiple coaches at a eval station can enter data for each player.  RNLL then averages out coach input per player.  Database schema changes and db model changes made to satisfy criteria.

Contact me if you are interested in using this for your Little League evals.
